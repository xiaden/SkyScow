### One container. Every tool. Any provider.

OpenCode running in a container with everything already installed. 50+ dev tools, 10+ AI providers, headless browser, persistent state, and two serious upgrades on top: Hermes Agent and Paperclip. Drop it on any machine and pick up exactly where you left off.

**Hermes Agent turns HolyCode into a meta-agent runtime.** You get a smarter planning layer on top of OpenCode, an API surface on port `8642`, MCP support, messaging adapters, and a clean way to let a "brain" delegate code work into the local container instead of bolting that together yourself.

**Paperclip turns HolyCode into an agent board.** You get a dashboard on port `3100` where you create a company, hire OpenCode-backed workers, wake them on heartbeat, and manage agent work from a real UI instead of hand-rolling scripts around `opencode run`.

**Works with your Claude subscription.** Enable the Claude Auth plugin and use your existing Claude Max/Pro plan. No separate API key needed.

**Multi-agent orchestration built in.** Enable oh-my-openagent and turn OpenCode into a coordinated agent system with parallel execution.

**You were going to spend an hour getting your environment back. Or you could just `docker compose up` and get a coding workstation, a meta-agent, and an agent board in one shot.**
> **Don't want to self-host?** [HolyCode Cloud](https://holycode.coderluii.dev/cloud) is coming. Same tools, zero setup. Early access is free.

---

## What is this?

You know the drill. You get your dev environment exactly right. Then you switch machines. Or rebuild a container. Or your system decides today is the day it dies.

Suddenly you're reinstalling tools. Hunting down config files. Re-entering API keys. Wondering why ripgrep isn't on PATH anymore. Figuring out why Chromium won't launch because Docker gives containers 64MB of shared memory. Then Xvfb isn't configured. Then the UID inside the container doesn't match your host and everything is permission denied.

**HolyCode is the container I built after solving every single one of those problems.**

It wraps [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), an AI coding agent with a built-in web UI. All your settings, sessions, MCP configs, plugins, and tool history live in a bind mount outside the container. Rebuild, update, or move to a new machine. Your state comes right back.

It's the same idea as [HolyClaude](https://github.com/coderluii/holyclaude) but wrapping OpenCode instead of Claude Code. And here's the thing: OpenCode isn't locked to one provider. Point it at Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq, AWS Bedrock, or Azure OpenAI. Same container, your choice of model.

50+ dev tools, two language runtimes, a headless browser stack, process supervision, and two bundled orchestration layers. All wired up, all ready on first boot. I've been running this on my own server. Every bug has been hit, diagnosed, and fixed.

You pull it. You run it. You open your browser. You build.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Step 1.** Pull the image.

```bash
docker pull coderluii/holycode:latest
```

**Step 2.** Create a `docker-compose.yaml`.

```yaml
services:
  holycode:
    image: coderluii/holycode:latest
    container_name: holycode
    restart: unless-stopped
    shm_size: 2g
    ports:
      - "4096:4096"
    volumes:
      - ./data/opencode:/home/opencode
      - ./local-cache/opencode:/home/opencode/.cache/opencode
      - ./workspace:/workspace
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

In that example, `/home/opencode` is the fixed path **inside** the container. On the host, `./data/opencode` and `./local-cache/opencode` are just example bind-mount paths relative to the folder containing your `docker-compose.yaml`. You can replace them with any host paths you want.

**Step 3.** Start it.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:4096. You're in.

> The shipped `docker-compose.yaml` uses `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}` syntax which reads from your shell environment or a `.env` file. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API key.

> `./data/opencode` is only an example host path. If your compose file lives at `/opt/holycode`, that same bind mount becomes `/opt/holycode/data/opencode` on the host.

> Keep `./local-cache/opencode` on local disk. If this project folder lives on NAS/CIFS/SMB storage, change that cache mount to an absolute local host path instead.

## ⚡ Why HolyCode

I built this because I was tired of re-doing the same setup every time. Installing OpenCode, wiring up a headless browser, fixing permission issues, debugging process supervision. Every. Time.

So I made a container that does all of it. And then I hit every possible bug so you don't have to.

| | HolyCode | DIY |
|---|----------|-----|
| Time to first working session | Under 2 minutes | 30-60 minutes |
| Chromium + Xvfb headless browser | Pre-configured | Research, install, debug yourself |
| Dev tool suite (ripgrep, fzf, lazygit, etc.) | Pre-installed | Hunt down and install one by one |
| State persistence across rebuilds | Automatic via bind mount | Manual bind mounts, easy to misconfigure |
| UID/GID file permission remapping | Built-in PUID/PGID | Dockerfile chmod hacks |
| Multi-arch support | amd64 + arm64 out of the box | Build and push both yourself |
| Updates | `docker pull` + `compose up` | Rebuild from scratch, hope nothing breaks |

<p align="right">
  <a href="#top">back to top</a>
</p>

## 🤖 Provider Support

OpenCode is provider-agnostic. Set whichever API key you use and you're done.

| Provider | Environment Variable | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude models |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT models |
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini models |
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` | Fast inference |
| AWS Bedrock | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` | Set all three |
| Azure OpenAI | `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | Set all three |
| GitHub | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Copilot via OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Vertex AI | (configured via OpenCode) | Google Vertex AI models |
| GitHub Models | (configured via OpenCode) | GitHub-hosted models |
| Ollama | (configured via OpenCode) | Local models via Ollama |

You only need to set keys for providers you actually use. Everything else is optional and ignored.

Vertex AI, GitHub Models, and Ollama are configured through OpenCode's provider system. Run `opencode providers login` inside the container.

      # --- Cache path ---
      # Keep this one on LOCAL disk for plugin/cache reliability.
      # If your main data path lives on NAS/CIFS/SMB, make this a separate local path.

      # - ENABLE_CLAUDE_AUTH=true

      # --- oh-my-openagent (multi-agent orchestration for OpenCode) ---
      # Enables the plugin through OpenCode config on container start
      # Toggle on/off with docker compose down && up -d
      # - ENABLE_OH_MY_OPENAGENT=true
```

For the optional CLIProxyAPI sidecar, use the shipped `docker-compose.full.yaml` profile instead of the quick-start compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yaml --profile cliproxyapi up -d
```

HolyCode reaches that sidecar at `http://cliproxyapi:8317/v1` inside the Compose network. The sidecar is disabled by default and does not replace Claude Auth.

## 🐳 Podman

Prefer Podman? HolyCode uses the same container image there too. The Podman guide covers the minimal `podman run` setup, env-file usage, SELinux labels, rootless permissions, and update/recreate behavior.

| `PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID` | `default` | Local Paperclip instance name for isolated state |
| `PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_MODE` | `authenticated` | Docker-safe Paperclip startup mode; HolyCode defaults this away from `local_trusted` |
| `PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES` | (none) | Comma-separated Paperclip remote hostnames/IPs to allow; use hostname/IP only, no scheme or port |
| `ENABLE_HERMES` | (none) | Set to `true` to start Hermes as a bundled meta-agent API |
| `HERMES_PORT` | `8642` | Override the container port used by Hermes |
| `CLIPROXYAPI_ENABLED` | (none) | Set to `true` to add the optional OpenCode `cliproxyapi` provider |
| `CLIPROXYAPI_BASE_URL` | `http://cliproxyapi:8317/v1` | CLIProxyAPI OpenAI-compatible base URL from the HolyCode container |
| `CLIPROXYAPI_API_KEY` | (none) | Optional API key for CLIProxyAPI, stored only as an OpenCode env reference when set |
| `CLIPROXYAPI_MODEL` | (none) | Optional primary model key exposed as `cliproxyapi/<model>` |
| `CLIPROXYAPI_SMALL_MODEL` | (none) | Optional smaller/faster model key exposed as `cliproxyapi/<model>` |
| `HOLYCODE_PLUGIN_UPDATE` | `manual` | Plugin update mode: `manual` (install if missing) or `auto` (install and update on boot) |

> Plugin toggles (`ENABLE_CLAUDE_AUTH`, `ENABLE_OH_MY_OPENAGENT`) take effect on container restart. Set the env var and run `docker compose down && up -d`.

> `HOLYCODE_PLUGIN_UPDATE` controls plugin package updates. `manual` (default) installs enabled plugins only if they are missing. `auto` installs missing plugins and updates enabled plugins on every boot. This is separate from `OPENCODE_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE`, which only affects OpenCode itself.

> `ENABLE_OH_MY_OPENAGENT=true` enables the plugin through the main OpenCode config at `/home/opencode/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. On the host, that file appears under whatever host path you bind to `/home/opencode`. On boot, HolyCode also checks whether the plugin package is missing and installs it if needed.

> `ENABLE_OH_MY_OPENAGENT=true` enables the plugin and exposes the built-in `/oh-my-openagent-setup` skill. The skill only appears when the plugin is enabled. Use it to create or update the plugin-specific config file at `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc`.

> `ENABLE_PAPERCLIP=true` starts Paperclip on port `3100` inside the container. Open the dashboard, create a company, then hire OpenCode-backed agents there. Paperclip persists under `~/.paperclip` automatically.

> HolyCode forces `PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=authenticated` by default because Paperclip's upstream `local_trusted` mode only allows loopback binding. In Docker, that would block port publishing on `0.0.0.0`.

> `PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES` lets Paperclip accept listed LAN/private hostnames or IPs. Use comma-separated hostname/IP values only, without `http://`, `https://`, or ports. Restart the container after changing it. The hostname guard and Paperclip authentication stay enabled.

> `ENABLE_HERMES=true` starts Hermes on port `8642` inside the container. Hermes persists under `~/.hermes`, uses the already-installed `opencode` binary, and can expose an OpenAI-compatible API while delegating code work back into HolyCode.

> Hermes is an API service, not a landing page. A `404` at `http://localhost:8642/` is expected. The important signal is that the port is listening and the process stays healthy.

> `CLIPROXYAPI_ENABLED=true` adds a separate OpenCode provider named `cliproxyapi`. It does not change `ENABLE_CLAUDE_AUTH`, does not touch `/home/opencode/.claude`, and does not set global `ANTHROPIC_*` proxy variables. When using the full-compose sidecar, keep `CLIPROXYAPI_BASE_URL=http://cliproxyapi:8317/v1`.

> CLIProxyAPI sidecar state lives under `./local-cache/cliproxyapi-config`, `./local-cache/cliproxyapi-auth`, and `./local-cache/cliproxyapi-logs`. The API port `8317` is not published to the host by default; uncomment loopback-only host publishing in `docker-compose.full.yaml` only when you need local setup/admin access.

> `GIT_USER_NAME` and `GIT_USER_EMAIL` are only applied on first boot. To re-apply, delete the sentinel file and restart: `docker exec holycode rm /home/opencode/.config/opencode/.holycode-bootstrapped` then `docker compose restart`.

## 🧩 Bundled Services

HolyCode now ships with three optional layers on top of OpenCode. You do **not** need them to use the container. But if plain OpenCode gives you the hands, these add coordination, a control room, and centralized model routing.

- **Hermes Agent** is for when you want a smarter coordinator sitting above OpenCode.
- **Paperclip** is for when you want a board, a workflow, and actual agent management instead of just one-off prompts.
- **CLIProxyAPI** is for when you want one OpenAI-compatible endpoint that can route models/accounts through a separate sidecar.

Flip the env var, restart the container, and the service comes up alongside the normal web UI.

### Hermes Agent

Hermes is the "smarter brain" option. It runs as a bundled meta-agent, exposes an API service on port `8642`, and delegates coding work by calling the local `opencode` binary that HolyCode already ships.

Why that matters:

- **Planning above execution.** OpenCode does the hands-on coding. Hermes gives you a layer that can reason, coordinate, and delegate down into that local worker.
- **API-ready agent runtime.** You can point other tooling at Hermes instead of wiring your own service around OpenCode.
- **MCP and messaging in the same box.** HolyCode already solves the dev-environment side. Hermes adds the "agent platform" layer on top.
- **Persistent agent state.** Its data lives under `~/.hermes`, so rebuilds don't wipe the runtime you just configured.

If you want HolyCode to feel less like "a container with a coding tool" and more like "an AI runtime you can build systems on top of," Hermes is the part that changes that.

Turn it on with:

```yaml
environment:
  - ENABLE_HERMES=true
  - HERMES_PORT=8642
```

Hermes state lives under `/home/opencode/.hermes`, so it follows the same persistence story as the rest of HolyCode.

### Paperclip

Paperclip is the "agent board" option. It gives you a local dashboard on port `3100` where you create a company, hire agents, and let those agents wake up on schedule. Under the hood it spawns `opencode run` processes, so the workers are still HolyCode.

Why that matters:

- **A real control surface.** You stop treating agents like random shell commands and start treating them like a team with roles, tasks, and wake cycles.
- **OpenCode-backed workers, not a toy layer.** The board is Paperclip. The actual worker execution is still HolyCode doing real coding work.
- **Faster delegation experiments.** Create a company, assign work, and see how an agent workflow feels without building the orchestration stack yourself.
- **Persistent board state.** Data, config, storage, and embedded Postgres all live under `~/.paperclip`.

If Hermes is the brain, Paperclip is the control room. It's the thing you turn on when you want to manage agent work, not just launch it.

Turn it on with:

```yaml
environment:
  - ENABLE_PAPERCLIP=true
  - PAPERCLIP_PORT=3100
  - PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=authenticated
  - PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES=192.168.1.50,my-host.local
```

Paperclip state lives under `/home/opencode/.paperclip`. HolyCode bootstraps it in `authenticated` mode so Docker port publishing works cleanly. Open the dashboard, set up your company, and hire OpenCode-backed employees from there.

When opening Paperclip from another machine, set `PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES` to the hostname or IP from the browser URL, without `http://`, `https://`, or `:3100`. Use commas for multiple values and restart the container after changes. This only allowlists those private hostnames; it does not make Paperclip public or disable authentication.

### CLIProxyAPI

CLIProxyAPI is the "model router" option. It runs as an optional sidecar from the full Compose reference and exposes an OpenAI-compatible API on port `8317` inside the Docker network. HolyCode can add a separate OpenCode provider named `cliproxyapi` that points at that sidecar.

Why that matters:

- **One provider surface.** OpenCode can use `cliproxyapi/<model>` while CLIProxyAPI handles the account/model routing behind it.
- **Isolated from Claude Auth.** This does not replace `ENABLE_CLAUDE_AUTH`, does not touch `/home/opencode/.claude`, and does not set global Anthropic proxy variables.
- **No default host exposure.** The sidecar is reachable by HolyCode over Docker DNS as `http://cliproxyapi:8317/v1`; host port publishing is loopback-only and commented out by default.
- **Separate state.** Config, auth, and logs live under `./local-cache/cliproxyapi-*`, not under the OpenCode home or Claude credential folder.

Turn it on with:

```yaml
environment:
  - CLIPROXYAPI_ENABLED=true
  - CLIPROXYAPI_BASE_URL=http://cliproxyapi:8317/v1
  - CLIPROXYAPI_API_KEY=
  - CLIPROXYAPI_MODEL=your-model-id
```

Then start the full Compose profile:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yaml --profile cliproxyapi up -d
```

Create `./local-cache/cliproxyapi-config/config.yaml` before enabling the profile. Put CLIProxyAPI API keys/OAuth state in its own mounted config/auth paths; do not reuse `/home/opencode/.claude`.

```

The entrypoint handles user remapping, plugin toggles, optional bundled-service toggles, CLIProxyAPI provider injection, and first-boot setup. s6-overlay supervises Xvfb, the OpenCode web server, and any optional bundled services you enabled inside the HolyCode container. The CLIProxyAPI sidecar is a separate Compose service. Access the web UI at port 4096, Hermes on 8642, or Paperclip on 3100 when those services are enabled.

## 💻 CLI Usage

The web UI at port 4096 is the primary interface. But you can also use OpenCode directly from the command line inside the container.

### Interactive TUI

```bash
docker exec -it holycode bash
opencode
```

This opens OpenCode's full terminal UI with all the same features as the web version.

### One-shot commands

Run a single prompt without entering the TUI:

```bash
docker exec -it holycode bash -c "opencode run 'explain this codebase'"
```

### Attach to the running server

Connect a local TUI session to the already-running OpenCode web server:

```bash
docker exec -it holycode bash -c "opencode attach http://localhost:4096"
```

This shares the same session as the web UI. Changes in one appear in the other.

### Provider management

List and configure AI providers from inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it holycode bash -c "opencode providers list"
docker exec -it holycode bash -c "opencode providers login"
```

### oh-my-openagent setup and reconfiguration

If you enabled `ENABLE_OH_MY_OPENAGENT=true`, the `/oh-my-openagent-setup` skill becomes available. Use it to create or refresh the plugin-specific config:

```text
/oh-my-openagent-setup
```

That flow is the supported path for:

- first-time oh-my-openagent setup
- reconfiguring after adding or removing providers
- restoring the intended picker defaults so only the primary agents are visible

HolyCode's default picker policy is:

- visible: `sisyphus`, `hephaestus`, `prometheus`, `atlas`
- hidden subagents: `oracle`, `librarian`, `explore`, `metis`, `momus`, `multimodal-looker`, `sisyphus-junior`

If you add a new provider later and the visible default model still looks stale, rerun `/oh-my-openagent-setup`, then run:

```bash
docker exec -it holycode bash -c "bunx oh-my-opencode doctor"
docker exec -it holycode bash -c "bunx oh-my-opencode refresh-model-capabilities"
```

HolyCode can guide the supported refresh path, but upstream OpenCode and oh-my-openagent model-resolution behavior still controls the final visible model state.

### Useful commands

## 💾 Data and Persistence

Most OpenCode state lives under `/home/opencode` inside the container. On the host, that data appears wherever you bind-mount `/home/opencode`. In the default examples below, the host path is `./data/opencode`, but you can replace it with any path you want.

Plugin cache is mounted separately at `./local-cache/opencode` by default so you can keep that cache path on local disk even if your main data path is somewhere else.

| Host Path | Container Path | What's in it |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `./data/opencode/.config/opencode`* | `/home/opencode/.config/opencode` | Settings, agents, MCP configs, themes, plugins |
| `./data/opencode/.local/share/opencode`* | `/home/opencode/.local/share/opencode` | SQLite sessions database, MCP OAuth tokens |
| `./data/opencode/.local/state/opencode`* | `/home/opencode/.local/state/opencode` | Frecency data, model cache, key-value store |
| `./local-cache/opencode` | `/home/opencode/.cache/opencode` | Plugin node_modules, auto-installed dependencies |

\* These `./data/opencode/...` paths are example host paths from the sample compose file. If you bind `/home/opencode` to a different host path, the same subdirectories will appear there instead.

Rebuild the container anytime. Run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` and your sessions, settings, and configs come back automatically.

**SQLite WAL note.** The sessions database uses Write-Ahead Logging. Don't copy the `.db` file while the container is running. Stop the container first if you need to back up or migrate the database file.

**Network storage note.** If `./data/opencode` is on a CIFS/SMB network mount (NAS, Synology, TrueNAS), you need two mount options:
- `nobrl` — SQLite WAL mode requires this (byte-range locking workaround)
- `mfsymlinks` — plugin installation requires this (symlink support for node_modules)

Keep `./local-cache/opencode` on local disk. If your whole HolyCode folder lives on network storage, change that cache mount to an absolute local host path such as `/var/lib/holycode-cache/opencode:/home/opencode/.cache/opencode`.

## 🔐 Permissions

HolyCode uses `PUID` and `PGID` to remap the internal container user to match your host user. This means files written to `./workspace` are owned by you, not by root.

Find your IDs on Linux and macOS:

```bash
id -u   # PUID
id -g   # PGID
```

On most systems this is `1000:1000`. On macOS it's often `501:20`. Set them in your compose file:

```yaml
environment:
  - PUID=501
  - PGID=20
```

If you skip this, files in your workspace may be owned by root and you'll need sudo to edit them from the host.

## ⬆️ Upgrading

Pull the latest image and recreate the container. Your data stays untouched.

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. One command. Your sessions, settings, and configs are in the bind mount so nothing is lost.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Chromium crashes or browser automation fails</strong></summary>

The most common cause is not enough shared memory. Chromium needs at least 1-2 GB of `/dev/shm` to run reliably.

Make sure your compose file has `shm_size: 2g`:

```yaml
services:
  holycode:
    shm_size: 2g
```

Without this, Chromium will crash silently or produce broken screenshots.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Permission denied on workspace files</strong></summary>

Your `PUID` and `PGID` don't match your host user. Find your IDs:

```bash
id -u && id -g
```

Update your compose environment section to match:

```yaml
environment:
  - PUID=1001   # replace with your actual UID
  - PGID=1001   # replace with your actual GID
```

Then recreate the container: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Port 4096 already in use</strong></summary>

Something else on your machine is using port 4096. Remap to a different host port:

```yaml
ports:
  - "4097:4096"   # access via http://localhost:4097
```

Or find and stop the conflicting process:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
lsof -i :4096

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :4096
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Container starts but web UI never loads</strong></summary>

Check the container logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f holycode
```

OpenCode takes a few seconds to initialize. Give it 10-15 seconds after `docker compose up -d` before opening the browser. If it's still not up, the logs will tell you why.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why doesn't HolyCode need SYS_ADMIN or seccomp=unconfined?</strong></summary>

Chromium runs with `--no-sandbox` inside the container, which is standard for containerized browser setups. This eliminates the need for `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities or `seccomp=unconfined` that some other Docker browser setups require. The container itself provides the isolation boundary.

If you prefer to use Chromium's built-in sandbox instead, add the following to your compose file and remove `--no-sandbox` from the `CHROMIUM_FLAGS` environment variable:

```yaml
cap_add:
  - SYS_ADMIN
security_opt:
  - seccomp=unconfined
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SQLite WAL or plugins fail on CIFS/SMB network mounts (NAS)</strong></summary>

If your `./data/opencode` directory lives on a CIFS/SMB network share (e.g. NAS, Synology, TrueNAS), OpenCode may fail with:

```
Failed to run the query 'PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL'
```

OpenCode uses SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for its sessions database. WAL requires byte-range locking, which CIFS/SMB doesn't support by default.

HolyCode detects this at startup and prints a warning with the fix instructions.

**Fix:** Add `nobrl,mfsymlinks` to your CIFS mount options in `/etc/fstab`:

```
# Before
//192.168.1.100/share /mnt/share cifs credentials=/etc/smbcreds,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0

# After — add nobrl and mfsymlinks
//192.168.1.100/share /mnt/share cifs credentials=/etc/smbcreds,uid=1000,gid=1000,nobrl,mfsymlinks 0 0
```

Then remount:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/share
sudo mount /mnt/share
```

Restart HolyCode: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`

If you are using the default HolyCode Compose files, the cache mount is `./local-cache/opencode:/home/opencode/.cache/opencode`. Keep that path on local disk. If your entire HolyCode folder lives on network storage, replace it with an absolute local host path.
