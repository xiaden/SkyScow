- Add runtime OpenCode `cliproxyapi` provider wiring behind `CLIPROXYAPI_ENABLED`

### Changed

- Document CLIProxyAPI setup, environment variables, and isolated local-cache state paths in English docs

### Fixed

- Keep CLIProxyAPI configuration isolated from `ENABLE_CLAUDE_AUTH`, `opencode-claude-auth`, and Claude credential paths

## [1.0.6] - 05/27/2026

### Added

- Add Renovate-only dependency automation for GitHub Actions, Dockerfile pins, Docker ARGs, npm packages, and PyPI packages with automerge disabled

### Changed

- Pin Docker and runtime dependency versions for repeatable builds
- Refresh workflow action versions to current stable tags

### Fixed

- Preserve user-owned `oh-my-openagent-setup` skill folders while cleaning up HolyCode-managed copies when the plugin is disabled
- Document local `local-cache/` guidance for quick-start setups
- Repair translated README contributing links so they resolve to the source repo contribution guide

## [1.0.5] - 04/10/2026

### Added

- Add Hermes Agent as an optional bundled service with `ENABLE_HERMES`, persistent `~/.hermes` state, and an API surface on port `8642`
- Add Paperclip as an optional bundled service with `ENABLE_PAPERCLIP`, persistent `~/.paperclip` state, and a local dashboard on port `3100`
- Install Claude Code CLI in the image so the Claude Auth flow has the binary it expects
- Expand the shipped toolset with TypeScript, pnpm, Prisma, Lighthouse, database CLIs, media tools, and Python utility packages
- Add a pull-request validation workflow that builds the image and smoke-checks the OpenCode binary

### Changed

- Refresh the docs, translations, Docker Hub description, and landing page to reflect the new bundled services and the larger 50+ toolset
- Extend the default compose and env examples with Hermes and Paperclip toggles

### Fixed

- Resolve the `python-dotenv` and `dotenv-cli` binary collision so the image builds cleanly
- Switch Hermes to its foreground gateway runner and bootstrap Paperclip in a Docker-safe authenticated mode so both bundled services start correctly under s6-overlay
- Remove shell-expanded Python config edits from `entrypoint.sh` by passing data into Python safely
- Repair broken asset and LICENSE paths in the affected translated READMEs
- Remove stale Slim-variant references from the package request issue template

## [1.0.4] - 04/04/2026

### Added

- Ship a built-in `/oh-my-openagent-setup` skill for first-time setup and reruns after provider changes (only visible when `ENABLE_OH_MY_OPENAGENT=true`)
- Copy HolyCode-managed OpenCode skills into `~/.config/opencode/skills` on boot without overwriting existing user skill folders
- Ensure enabled plugin packages are installed on boot if they are missing from the OpenCode cache
- Add `HOLYCODE_PLUGIN_UPDATE` environment variable with two modes: `manual` (install if missing only) and `auto` (install if missing and update on boot)

### Changed

- Document `/oh-my-openagent-setup` as the supported path for writing `oh-my-openagent.jsonc`
- Document the default picker policy so only Sisyphus, Hephaestus, Prometheus, and Atlas are visible by default
- Clarify that `OPENCODE_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE` only affects OpenCode itself, not plugins
- Clarify that `/oh-my-openagent-setup` skill only appears when the plugin is enabled

### Fixed

- Add an explicit rerun + doctor + model-capability refresh path for stale visible default-model behavior after provider changes

## [1.0.2] - 04/03/2026

### Changed

- Clarify that `/home/opencode` is the fixed container path while the host data path depends on the bind mount the user chooses
- Clarify that main data can live on remote storage while the cache path should remain local
- Clarify that `ENABLE_OH_MY_OPENAGENT=true` enables the plugin through `opencode.json` without promising a separate plugin-specific config file on the host

## [1.0.1] - 04/02/2026

### Fixed

- Detect CIFS/SMB network mounts and warn about SQLite WAL incompatibility
- Add `nobrl,mfsymlinks` mount option documentation for README Troubleshooting section

### Changed
